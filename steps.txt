This is a documented script of how to make a repository,add, and commit a file in the repo.
Step 1: Create a new folder and turn this folder into a repository

Code:
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir homework2  #this is a new folder
cd homework2     #change a directory to the recently made folder
git init         #turn this directory into a repository

Step 2: Add new files to the directory
touch file1.txt file2.txt  #add files to the directory
touch steps.txt  #this is the current file. Adding texts here
git add steps.txt   #start keeping track of this file
git add file1.txt    #keeping track of another file

Step 3: Explore git log, git diff and git show
git log          #view previous commits occurred in the project/repo
git diff         #compare current and previous (saved) versions

Step 4: Make a repo in Github 
1. go to Github, repositoty, add new repo. 
2. push change from laptop to the remore repository
